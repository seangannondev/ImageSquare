Image Square is a simple app that will take your rectangular image and square it.

The idea is to crop the outermost pixels in order to make the image square.

THIS WILL NOT RETAIN THE FULL IMAGE. THERE WILL BE A PORTION OF IT LOST!

How to:

1. Simply open your command prompt and navigate to the Image square directory.

2. Execute the PictureSquare.py file followed by the image you would like to square.

Example:
            python PictureSquare.py C:\AppSecurity\testimage.jpg


    The above example will square an image called 'testimage.jpg' that I have saved in the AppSecurity folder

After completion, you will find the squared image saved as newimg.jpg in the ImageSquare directory
